# Bikesharing
Analysis of a bike-sharing program in NYC for starting the same program at Des Moines.

#### Background
After analysing the data of NYC Citibike sharing program through Tableau, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

After doing the necassary conversion of trip duration in the jupyter notebook as shown below, we started to build the story. Our main purpose is to the Investors:
- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

#### And finally, weâ€™ll add these new visualizations to our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. The link to the story is below:

Summary:
The results of this analysis have given insight into the utilization of bicycles in the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program. We've seen the patterns of useage by time and by gender. Utilization rates can now be predicted based on time of day and location. Weekday useage is heavily concentrated around the morning and afternoon commute. Weekend useage is more evenly spread through the day. We would recommend further analysis for a few points. Firstly, while we've seen that the vast majority of trips are 30 min or less, we should perform further analysis to compare weekend trip durations to weekday trip durations. We should also look further into the patterns of useage for the bicycles that see the heaviest use, perhaps preparing maps showing all of the starting/ending routes/locations for the heaviest use bikes. We should also prepare a visualization to determine if there are specific locations that are completely unused.
